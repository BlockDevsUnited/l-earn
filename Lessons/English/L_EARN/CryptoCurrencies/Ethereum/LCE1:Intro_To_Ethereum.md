## 1. History of Ethereum
### What brought about ethereum 
Ethereum was launched in July 2015 by a small group of blockchain enthusiasts. They included Joe Lubin, founder of ConsenSys, a blockchain applications developer that uses the Ethereum network. Another co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, is credited with originating the Ethereum concept and now serves as its CEO and public face. Buterin is sometimes described as the world's youngest crypto billionaire. (He was born in 1994.)


## 2. Theory
### What is Ethereum

Ethereum is an open source software running on a decentralized network of computers. Ethereum maintains consensus across all the computers in it's network with Proof of Work (PoW). In the near future Ethereum will be moving to a Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism.

### Ethereum Basics
#### What is Ether
Ethereum has a native currency called "Ether", or "Eth".

#### What are Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are small computer programs that are replicated and processed on all the computers on the Ethereum network without a central coordinator. Smart Contracts allow you to program contracts that can be automatically enforced by computer code.
Ethereum was created to enable developers to build and publish smart contracts and distributed applications (dApps) that can be used without the risks of downtime, fraud, or interference from a third party.




#### What are ERC20 Tokens
An ERC20 token is a standard used for creating and issuing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts can then be used to create smart property or tokenized assets that people can invest in. ERC stands for "Ethereum request for comment," and the ERC20 standard was implemented in 2015.
In addition to Ether, people can also create and use their own currencies on Ethereum. The most common form of currency is ERC20 tokens. ERC20 Tokens are smart contracts that fit the ERC20 standard. The ERC20 standard was created so that everyone could follow it and create tokens that behave in the same way.

#### Your keys, your crypto
Never give out your private keys or seed phrase. If anyone ever asks for them, refuse!

## 3 Prospect of Ethereum 
 With a current price of $4,205.79 and a market cap of $491.38 billion, Ethereum (ETH) shows no sign of slowing down. The so-called digital silver has grown by almost $3,500 since the start of 2021, after initially hitting a price of $1,000 in January 2021. 
 Unlike many other crypto assets, Ethereum has maintained its market position during the latest upturn. Before 2021, its all-time high (ATH) was around $1,127. So, how high should we expect its price to soar? Although 2021 saw the majority of cryptocurrencies gain value, many big names have also been displaced. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum have both retained their top spots, so confidence in both assets remains high. 
 According to recent long-term forecasts, the price of Ethereum could reach $7,000 by the end of 2022, rising to $11,342.80 by the end of 2023 and $46,180 by the end of 2025. Ethereum will then rise to $51,333.97 in 2027, and $164,984.04 in 2030.

## 4. Practice

### Using Metamask
- Go to [MetaMask](https://metamask.io)

- Follow the instructions and install the Metamask browser extension.

- Once you get your new seed phrase, (a 12 word phrase), write it down somewhere safe. This is your wallet backup.

## 5. Testing

For this pilot phase of BDU L-EARN, you'll have one of our collaborators test your knowledge on a 1-on-1 conversation, using [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) to verify your identity. Get in touch with them via this repo or on the Telegram group on our website.

### Share your Ethereum address
Once Metamask is installed, copy your address and send it to one of the owners of this repo. Reward: 4 xDai.
