### Technical Details
Devcash is an ERC20 Token, originally created on Ethereum on [January 8, 2018](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x73921cdeb3ad1baa4cc11ddaeb8492056a6c63ddb71089fb80ceb44c60c598a1).

Devcash is also bridged to xDaiChain (now Gnosis Chain), to take advantage of cheap transaction fees. This is known as "Devcash on xDAI", and is probably what you will be using.

A Blockchain called DevChain is planned, where Devcash will be the native token. When DevChain is created, All existing Devcash on Ethereum, Gnosis Chain and elsewhere will be redeemable 1 to 1 for native Devcash.

### Economics
There is 2.1 Billion Devcash in existence, with a fixed supply. Most Devcash (about 87%) is currently held in [this multisig wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBe9AB77E88bFdA9491A4d18522C1d837D901673F) managed by early Devcash contributors.

#### Distribution

### Developer Bounties
Developer Bounties a central to Devcash. We use bounties to incentivize devs to help build mission critical apps, and services, and make devs the primary holders of Devcash.

We use the [Devcash Bounty Platform](https://xdai.devcash.dev) to Post Bounties.

Our aim is build valuable developer resources, which increases the price of Devcash, which lets us build more dev resources, which further increases the price, which builds even more dev resources, and so on! This a virtuous cycle.

## Practice

You should have Devcash left over from your previous lessons. If not you can buy a small amount with your xDai.
