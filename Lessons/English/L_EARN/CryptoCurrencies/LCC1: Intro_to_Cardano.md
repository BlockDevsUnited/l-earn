# Intro to Cardano
Cardano is a third-generation decentralized Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain platform. It is a collection of open-source, patent-free protocols. It's a platform that enables you to store, transform, and manage value, identity, and governance. Cardano follows research not opinions or bias.

Foundation, decentralization, smart contracts, scaling, and governance are the five stages of Cardano development. 

Cardano is an open platform that seeks to provide economic identity to the billions who lack it by providing decentralized applications to manage identity, value and governance.

The Cardano platform runs on the Ouroboros consensus protocol. Ouroboros, created by Cardano in its foundation phase, is the first PoS protocol that not only was proved to be secure, but also was the first to be informed by scholarly academic research. Each development phase, or era, in the Cardano roadmap is anchored by the research-based framework, incorporating peer-reviewed insights with evidence-based methods to make progress toward and achieve the milestones related to the future directions of the use applications of both the blockchain network and the ada token.

Cardano oversight is decentralized and shared by The Cardano Foundation, IOHK, and EMURGO.

## What Is ADA?

* “ADA" is the name of Cardano's principal cryptocurrency. It is based on the Cardano blockchain, a first-of-its-kind decentralized network built entirely on scientific and mathematical principles by cryptography and engineering experts.

* Its purpose is to provide a rapid and secure value transaction and allow users to operate smart contracts and applications.

* Sending and receiving funds instantly and for a low fee has numerous applications in the business and financial worlds.

* It is a Proof-of-Stake coin used to fuel Cardano Ecosystem.


### The Layers of the Cardano Network:

There are two layers to the Cardano blockchain:
1. The Settlement Layer, and 
2. The Computation Layer 

* The CSL contains the ledger of accounts and balances (and is where the transactions are validated by the Ouroboros consensus mechanism)
* The CCL layer is where all the computations for apps running on the blockchain are executed — via the operations of smart contracts.
* 
The idea of splitting the blockchain into two layers is to help the Cardano network to process as many as a million transactions a second.

Unlike Ethereum-based tokens, Cardano native tokens aren’t created via smart contract. Instead, they run on the same architecture as the ADA cryptocurrency itself.

### What does Cardano do?What does Cardano do?

Cardano enables several different features on its platform:

* **Currency**: With a cryptocurrency wallet, you can send and receive Cardano or transfer it in exchange for goods and services.

* **Smart contracts**: Cardano enables smart contracts, which are contracts that automatically self-execute when the contract’s conditions are fulfilled.

* **Decentralized finance**: Cardano enables people to skip the middleman, such as banks and other financial institutions, to transact directly and on a permission-less basis with other individuals or entities.

* **Digital apps**: As part of decentralized finance, Cardano can enable lending, trading, asset management, insurance and other typical financial services.


## Practice

### Set up a Cardano(ADA) Wallet

For this lesson, all you need to do is set up a Cardano(ADA) Wallet. 
There are many wallets available, included Atomic Wallet, IMToken, Enjin wallet, and Trust Wallet. You can hold ADA on Coinbase, in Coinbase Wallet, and using a number of crypto exchanges and wallets.

## Testing

For this pilot phase of BDU L-EARN, you'll have one of our collaborators test your knowledge on a 1-on-1 conversation, using BrightID to verify your identity. Get intouch with them via this repo or on the Telegram group on our website. Reward: 4 xDai.
