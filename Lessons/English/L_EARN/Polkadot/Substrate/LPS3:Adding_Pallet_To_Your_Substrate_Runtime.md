# Adding a simple pallet to your substrate runtime

Reward - 0.2 DOT

## Prerequisite

To complete this lesson, you need to make sure that you have completed the prerequisite of this lesson which is [Creating the first substrate blockchain](https://github.com/antron3000/Polkadot-L-EARN/blob/master/Lessons/English/L_EARN/Polkadot/Substrate/LPS2:Create_Your_First_Substrate_Blockchain.md)

## Theory

In the previous lesson [Creating the first substrate blockchain](https://github.com/antron3000/Polkadot-L-EARN/blob/master/Lessons/English/L_EARN/Polkadot/Substrate/LPS2:Create_Your_First_Substrate_Blockchain.md), we learned all about Substrate and how to create a Substrate based blockchain.
In this tutorial, we will learn about how to add our custom modules to the runtime provided by Substrate.
We will add our custom FRAME pallets to the node template, which we have created in our previous lesson.

## Practice

Follow the tutorial here [Adding a pallet](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/add-a-pallet/) 

## Testing

When ready, reach out to [schedule a test](https://github.com/antron3000/Polkadot-L-EARN/blob/master/Lessons/English/L_EARN/L1:Intro_To_Polkadot_L-EARN.md#schedule-a-test)

To pass the test you must
- complete the practice tutorial
- display understanding of substrate blockchains
- run a substrate based blockchain node
- demonstrate a front end project that interacts with your node
