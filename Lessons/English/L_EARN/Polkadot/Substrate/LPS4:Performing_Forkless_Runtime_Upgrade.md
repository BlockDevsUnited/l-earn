## Prerequisite

To complete this lesson, you need to make sure that you have completed the prerequisite of this lesson which is [Adding pallet to your substrate runtime](https://github.com/Polkadot-L-EARN/Polkadot-L-EARN/blob/master/Lessons/English/L_EARN/Polkadot/Substrate/LPS3:Adding_Pallet_To_Your_Substrate_Runtime.md)

## Theory

In the previous lesson [Adding pallet to your substrate runtime](https://github.com/Polkadot-L-EARN/Polkadot-L-EARN/blob/master/Lessons/English/L_EARN/Polkadot/Substrate/LPS3:Adding_Pallet_To_Your_Substrate_Runtime.md), we learned about how we can add a pallet to the substrate blockchain
In this tutorial, we will advance our learning by testing one of the most powerful feature of the substrate based blockchains `Forkless upgrade`.
We will see how we can add new functionality to the node and upgrade the runtime without doing any hard fork or stopping the node.

## Practice

Follow the tutorial here [Forkless upgrade](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/forkless-upgrades/) 

## Testing

When ready, reach out to [schedule a test](https://github.com/antron3000/Polkadot-L-EARN/blob/master/Lessons/English/L_EARN/L1:Intro_To_Polkadot_L-EARN.md#schedule-a-test)

To pass the test you must
- complete the practice tutorial
- display understanding of substrate blockchains
- run a substrate based blockchain node
- demonstrate a front end project that interacts with your node
