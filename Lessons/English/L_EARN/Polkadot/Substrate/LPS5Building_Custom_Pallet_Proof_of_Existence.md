## Prerequisite

To complete this lesson, you need to make sure that you have completed the prerequisite of this two lessons which are [Create your First Substrate Blockchain](https://github.com/Polkadot-L-EARN/Polkadot-L-EARN/blob/master/Lessons/English/L_EARN/Polkadot/Substrate/LPS2:Create_Your_First_Substrate_Blockchain.md) and [Adding a pallet to your substrate runtime](https://github.com/Polkadot-L-EARN/Polkadot-L-EARN/blob/master/Lessons/English/L_EARN/Polkadot/Substrate/LPS3:Adding_Pallet_To_Your_Substrate_Runtime.md)

## Theory

In the previous lessons [Create your First Substrate Blockchain](https://github.com/Polkadot-L-EARN/Polkadot-L-EARN/blob/master/Lessons/English/L_EARN/Polkadot/Substrate/LPS2:Create_Your_First_Substrate_Blockchain.md) and [Adding a pallet to your substrate runtime](https://github.com/Polkadot-L-EARN/Polkadot-L-EARN/blob/master/Lessons/English/L_EARN/Polkadot/Substrate/LPS3:Adding_Pallet_To_Your_Substrate_Runtime.md), we learned all about Substrate and how to create a Substrate based blockchain and how we can add a pallet to the substrate blockchain.
In this tutorial, we will advance our learning how to create a custom proof-of-existence (PoE) service using the Substrate blockchain development framework and the FRAME library.
We will see how we can add add events, errors, storage, and callable functions to a custom pallet,integrate into runtime and compile it.

## Practice

Follow the tutorial here, [Build Proof of existence](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/proof-of-existence/) 

## Testing

When ready, reach out to [discord](https://discord.com/channels/602343106981134336/791130887734820865) or [telegram](https://t.me/PolkadotLearn)

To pass the test you must
- learn the basics of how to create a new custom pallet
- integrate the custom pallet into the runtime.
- compile and start a node that includes your custom pallet.
- demonstrate how you can add a React front-end component to expose the custom pallet to users.
