# Lesson 3: Kitty Frontend Hacking

In this lesson, you will learn all the basics of Substrate and FRAME and writing a custom pallet.
You will build a Substrate node, run it and connect it to a front end running in your browser.

## Build the Substrate Kitties node

Complete the [Kitties tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/kitties/pt1/). 
There's a lot of good material there that will teach you how to build a pallet from scratch. 
Make sure you understand what the code is doing before moving from one section to the next.

## Launch the Kitty front end

Complete [this tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/kitties/pt2/) to learn how to create React components for the Substrate Kitties chain you built. 

## Task

1. Rename your Substrate Kitties node and pallet functions. 
    We want to see that your blockchain was built by you and not just copy pasted from the solution. 
    Find places that you can customize to make it more you.
1. Write logic in the `KittyCards.js` component that adds a button to allow a user to breed two Kitties. 
1. Add some other customization of your choice (for example, a new layout, different UI components, different avatars..).

## Testing

After completing this lesson, let us know when you are ready to take the test. 
The tester will verify the tasks you've completed and ask you questions.
The reward for passing is 0.3 DOT.
