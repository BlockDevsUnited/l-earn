BrightID is a social identity network developed to verify the particularity of its users within the applications that make use of it. It does not employ a centralized authority, but determines the uniqueness of an individual by applying a social chart. Those who download the BrightID app will be required to attend a "verification party" of their choice, these are hosted daily by the project's collaborators through Zoom. The groupal QR code will be scanned along with a specific number of other participants and, once they have connected with enough of the people in attendance, their username will be approved as a verified account. Likewise, these verified users will in turn have the authority to report others, if they were to be active through multiple accounts.

BrightID makes it possible for third-party applications to ensure that their consumers take on the use of a single account, guaranteeing that their communities will be able to enjoy a fair and equal participation and, consequently a better experience. Every user with a BrightID account establishes connections with people they trust and by doing so, the platform will create a graph of them. All of those considered potential falsifications will be analyzed by its system.
