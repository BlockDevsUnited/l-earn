# Getting Started With Polkadot L-EARN

Welcome! This lesson provides instructions on learning and earning with Polkadot L-EARN.

We are a Polkadot community project where you can learn about Polkadot and Earn DOT at the same time. Learning is peer to peer, and open source. Our goal is to train people with Polkadot skills, provide you with DOT income, and increase Polkadot adoption!

Read this lesson, take notes, and talk to a testing official at the end. You can earn 0.1 DOT at the end.

## Theory
Study this section to understand what Polkadot L-EARN is all about

### Learning
Learning about Polkadot is Polkadot L-EARN's primary focus. In this section you will learn what topics we offer, how lessons are structured, and about learning trees and learning paths.

#### Topics

We offer a small core of general lessons for beginners, and an expanded set of lessons for developers.

There are also a small number of lessons involving the Polkadot L-EARN platform itself, including this lesson.

#### Open Source
All lessons are open source and available in this Github repository and free for anyone.

#### Peer to Peer
We use peer to peer learning and teaching, and even testing.

Community members can become testers after going through an approval process

### Earning
Earning DOT is the second aspect of Polkadot L-EARN. In this section you will learn how to Earn DOT.

#### Passing Tests
Every lesson comes with a test. For this lesson, the test will just be a few yes/no questions confirming you understood the key points.

You can take as many tests as you want to accumulate rewards.  

Rewards are always in DOT!

#### Withdrawing
After accumulating DOT earnings, you must withdraw them to get it into your personal wallet.

Read carefully below to understand what conditions must be satisfied before withdrawing.

#### Verification
Verification is required to prevent Sybil attacks, that is individuals claiming multiple identities and multiple rewards.  

There are 2 ways to get verified on Polkadot L-EARN.
 - [get verified on BrightID](https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/getting-verified)
 - Get verified directly with a trusted community member.

You may accumulate earnings before verifying, but verification is required to withdraw rewards.

We try to make it as easy as possible to get verified, while remaining resistant to sybil attacks.

#### Minimum DOT Balance
The Polkadot Network does not allow balances less than 1 DOT. This is intended to reduce blockchain size and prevent spam.

In order to withdraw your DOT earnings, you must have at least 1 DOT in your wallet. If you cannot get 1 DOT, then you must accumulate 1 DOT in earnings before withdrawing.
