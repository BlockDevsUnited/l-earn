# Intro to BDU L-EARN

Welcome to BDU L-EARN! We are a Learn and Earn community started by [Block Devs United](https://bdu.dev), where you can **learn and earn crypto** at the same time!

In BDU L-EARN, education is peer to peer, where students learn from and teach each other directly. Join the community [here](https://t.me/bdu_learn).

The goal is to train people with cryptocurrency skills, provide accessible means to earn crypto, and drive cryptocurrency adoption all at the same time.

This lesson introduces you to BDU L-EARN, and teaches you how to get started.

Reward: 1 xDAI and 1,000 DCASH.

## Learn

Learning about cryptocurrency is our primary focus (learn first, earn second)! In this section you will learn what topics we focus on, how lessons are structured, and about learning trees and learning paths in BDU L-EARN.

### Topics

The primary topics are all cryptocurrency related. We cover the major cryptos Bitcoin and Ethereum, and constantly add more as we go.

We offer a small core of general crypto lessons for beginners, and an expanded set of lessons for blockchain developers. That's because BDU's core focus is to train blockchain developers.

There is also a small group of lessons involving the BDU L-EARN program itself. This includes lessons on our community, on contributions, on the need for identity, and this very lesson itself!

### Learning Tree

Our educational material is organized in a tree like structure. The tree has learning categories, or "branches", and lessons, or "leafs". We call this the learning tree.

#### Lesson codes
Lessons are named by letter codes. The letter codes represent a branch on the learning tree

For example:
```
L: Learn and Earn
LC: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency
LCE: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency - Ethereum
LCEX: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency - Ethereum - xDaiChain
```
Each branch has its lessons, or leafs.  For example, the branch LC: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency, has:
```
LC1: Intro_To_Cryptocurrency
LC2: Decentralized_Applications
LC3: Cold_Storage
```
and so on.

Every lesson has a place on the learning tree and is known by a lesson code. For example:
```
LCEXD1 - dApps on xDaiChain
```

#### Learning Paths

A learning path is a list of lessons taken from the learning tree, that is geared towards a particular learning outcome. Learning paths are basically equivalent to short courses.

Anyone can create learning paths and share with others. Students are also free to follow their own personal learning paths, and skip over lessons they know if desired.

### Open Source
All lessons are open source on Github and free to use for anyone.

### Peer to Peer
We encourage peer to peer learning and teaching, and even testing.

## Earn
True to the name, after learning a lesson, you can earn crypto. This works by passing a test or trial. After you pass you can get rewarded.

### Rewards
Every lesson has a reward attached. This lesson included! The reward for learning this lesson and passing the test at the end is 1 xDai and 1000 DCASH.

Rewards will be primarily in Devcash (DCASH). BDU L-EARN was created and is supported by the Devcash Team. You will learn more about Devcash, how to use it, trade it in the next few lessons!

Rewards are always in cryptocurrency! Sometimes the rewards are in different cryptos, depending on which sponsors fund our  program.

### Sponsors
Sponsors come in and fund this program, so that people can learn about their platform and earn their cryptocurrency.

This is where most of the money comes from to pay earners.

## Tests

Every lesson includes a test or trial at the end. Learners must pass this test to earn crypto. First you must study a lesson, and when you are ready you can take a test.

Testing at the moment is done manually in our Discord or Telegram groups. A tester will have a conversation with you, ask you questions, and ask you to complete exercises to prove you have learned the material.

A test is available for this lesson. [Go here to take the test when you are ready!](https://discord.gg/WvqSMfB7Jz). Ask to take a test in the l-earn channel.
