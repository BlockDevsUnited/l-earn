## Theory

### Learning
Learning about Polkadot is our primary focus. In this section you will learn what topics we offer, how lessons are structured, and about learning trees and learning paths.

#### Topics

We offer a small core of general lessons for beginners, and an expanded set of lessons for developers.

There is also a small group of lessons involving the Polkadot L-EARN program itself, including this lesson.

#### Open Source
All lessons are open source on Github and free to use for anyone.

#### Peer to Peer
We encourage peer to peer learning and teaching, and even testing.

### Earning
Earning DOT is the secondary aspect of Polkadot L-EARN. In this section you will learn how to Earn DOT, and the necessity of verification.

#### Pass Tests
Every lesson has a reward attached. This lesson included! The reward for learning this lesson and passing the test at the end is 0.2 DOT.

You can take as many tests as you want to accumulate rewards.  

Rewards are always in DOT!


#### Verification

Verification is required to prevent Sybil attacks, that is individuals claiming multiple identities and multiple rewards.  

There are 2 ways to get verified on Polkadot L-EARN.
 - [get verified on BrightID](https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/getting-verified)
 - In limited cases you get verified directly with a trusted community member.

You can accumulate earnings before verifying, but verification is required to withdraw rewards.

We try to make it as easy as possible to get verified, while remaining resistant to sybil attacks.
