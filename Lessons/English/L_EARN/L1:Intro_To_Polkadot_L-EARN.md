## Theory

### Learning
Learning about Polkadot is our primary focus. In this section you will learn what topics we offer, how lessons are structured, and about learning trees and learning paths.

#### Topics

We offer a small core of general lessons for beginners, and an expanded set of lessons for developers.

There is also a small group of lessons involving the Polkadot L-EARN program itself. This includes lessons on our community, on contributing, on identity, and this very lesson!

#### Learning Tree

Our educational material is organized in a tree like structure. The tree has learning categories, or "branches", and lessons, or "leafs". We call this the learning tree.

##### Lesson codes
Lessons are named by letter codes. The letter codes represent a branch on the learning tree

For example:
```
L: Learn and Earn
LP: Learn and Earn - Polkadot
LPS: Learn and Earn - Polkadot - Smart Contracts
```
Each branch has its lessons, or leafs.  For example, the branch LC: Learn and Earn - Cryptocurrency, has:
```
LP1: Intro_To_Polkadot
LP2: Decentralized_Applications
LP3: Cold_Storage
```
and so on. Every lesson has a place on the learning tree and is known by a lesson code.

#### Learning Paths

A learning path is a list of lessons taken from the learning tree, that is geared towards a particular learning outcome. Learning paths are basically equivalent to short courses.

Anyone can create learning paths and share with others. Students are also free to follow their own personal learning paths, and skip over lessons they know if desired.

#### Open Source
All lessons are open source on Github and free to use for anyone.

#### Peer to Peer
We encourage peer to peer learning and teaching, and even testing.

### Earning
Earning DOT is the secondary aspect of Polkadot L-EARN. In this section you will learn how to Earn DOT, and the necessity of verification.

#### Pass Tests
Every lesson has a reward attached. This lesson included! The reward for learning this lesson and passing the test at the end is 0.2 DOT.

You can take as many tests as you want to accumulate rewards.  

Rewards are always in DOT!


#### Verification

Verification is required to prevent Sybil attacks, that is individuals claiming multiple identities and therefore multiple rewards.  We try to make it as easy as possible to get verified, while remaining resistant to sybil attacks.

There are 2 ways to get verified on Polkadot L-EARN.
 - get verified on BrightID
 - In limited cases get verified directly with a trusted community member.

Though you can accumulate earnings before verifying, verification is required to withdraw rewards.
