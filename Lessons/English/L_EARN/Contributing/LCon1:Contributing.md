## Theory

### Becoming a Contributor
Anyone can be a contributor. You just need valuable knowledge, a passion for education, and some basic Github skills.

If you're looking for a lesson on a certain topic, but don't see it in BDU L-EARN, consider making it yourself! Teaching is one of the most effective ways to learn.

If you're familiar with Github and markdown, you can already start writing lessons, creating pull requests and bringing them up for discussion in the community channels.  

#### Writing lessons

### Github

GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control. GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects.

Developers use Github from the command line. For this lesson, it is enough to use Github through the website interface.

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. Markdown files end with .md.
