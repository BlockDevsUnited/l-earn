# Intro to POLYGON NETWORK

Polygon is a “layer 2” or “sidechain” scaling solution that runs alongside the Ethereum blockchain — allowing for speedy transactions and low fees. MATIC is the network’s native cryptocurrency, which is used for fees, staking, and more. You can buy or sell MATIC via exchanges like Coinbase.

The Polygon network is Ethereum-native, aligned to be interoperable with all of Ethereum’s existing and even future infrastructures while offering a framework for its interoperability with other layer-2 solutions, sidechains and sovereign blockchains.

Polygon reduces transaction fees on the Ethereum network while also increasing the speed of transactions drastically. The protocol enables instant transactions which cost a fraction of a penny ($0.002).

## How Does Polygon (MATIC) Work?

Polygon (MATIC) uses a variety of technologies to create a fast and highly scalable Layer 2 blockchain network:

* **Proof-of-Stake System** - Users validate transactions by staking their MATIC. Users can run a full node as a "validator" or they can delegate their MATIC to a trusted validator.
* **Polygon Protocol** - The protocol which enables Polygon and Ethereum based blockchains to connect with each other while inheriting Ethereum's security.
* **Commit Chains** - Transaction networks that run alongside the Ethereum blockchain, bundling transactions together before confirming them and returning the data back to the mainchain.
* **Polygon Framework** - One-click system for deploying Ethereum compatible blockchains using the Polygon SDK.

## Theory

Polygon is a Plasma-based aggregator, which is a layer-2 solution for Ethereum, that provides a framework for building decentralized apps (dApps) off-chain that have fortified security, scalability and speed.
The Plasma framework is one of the driving developments behind blockchain technology’s mass adoption.

#### How does Polygon work?

Polygon aims to transform Ethereum into a complete, multichain system, or internet of blockchains, similar to ecosystems like Polkadot and Cosmos, with the added advantages of Ethereum’s robust protocol and security. 

Blockchains launched on the Polygon network are based on its proof-of-stake (PoS) sidechain, which leverages a network of validators off the blockchain and then finalizes the transactions on Ethereum’s main chain afterward. This can take significant strain off the main blockchain, which results in less network congestion, faster transaction speed and lower gas fees.

The Polygon network supports two types of chains: stand-alone chains, which are self-sovereign blockchains on the Matic PoS chain and compatible with Ethereum, and secured chains, which fortify their security using a network of professional validators.

Polygon offers a range of scaling architecture for Ethereum, namely the Matic PoS Chain and Plasma Chain, that are already implemented at the time of writing. The network is working on developing further scaling infrastructure to help prepare Ethereum for mass adoption, such as:

* Polygon Plasma: A layer-2 solution that provides a framework for building dApps off-chain, benefiting from Ethereum’s secure infrastructure.
* ZK Rollups: A layer-2 solution based on zero-knowledge proof, meaning that it executes the transactions off-chain, only submitting the proof of validity to the main Ethereum chain.
* Optimistic Rollups: A layer 2 solution based on fraud proofs, that also executes the transactions off-chain, only submitting proof of fraud to the main blockchain if an invalid block is discovered. 
* Validum Chains: A layer 2 solution almost identical to ZK Rollups, except data availability is kept off-chain to prevent funds from being stolen.
* Stand-Alone Chains: Sovereign Ethereum sidechains, secured by their validators, that can be connected to the main blockchain via bridges.
* Shared Security Chains: Blockchains based on security as a service, meaning that their validation service is provided by a shared pool of PoS validators, managed on the Ethereum main chain.

All of the above-mentioned scaling mechanisms are built to boost the transaction throughput of Ethereum without sacrificing the network’s security and user experience. Experts hope that these will represent a solution for slow blockchain transactions without compromising the network’s decentralized nature.



## Practice

### Set up a Polkadot Wallet

For this lesson, all you need to do is set up a Polkadot Network [Here](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/). 
There are many wallets available, included Atomic Wallet, IMToken, Enjin wallet, and Trust Wallet. You can purchase on coinbase, Binance and many exchanges.

## Testing
