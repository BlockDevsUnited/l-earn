## what is blockchain? tutorial for beginners
 A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography. 
 Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).
The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published in order to get into its hash.
