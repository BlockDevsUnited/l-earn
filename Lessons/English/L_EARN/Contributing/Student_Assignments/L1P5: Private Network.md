## Prerequisite

To complete this lesson, you need to make sure that you have completed the prerequisite of this lesson which is [Creating the first substrate blockchain](https://github.com/antron3000/Polkadot-L-EARN/blob/master/Lessons/English/L_EARN/Polkadot/Substrate/LPS2:Create_Your_First_Substrate_Blockchain.md)

## Theory

In the previous lesson [Creating the first substrate blockchain](https://github.com/antron3000/Polkadot-L-EARN/blob/master/Lessons/English/L_EARN/Polkadot/Substrate/LPS2:Create_Your_First_Substrate_Blockchain.md), we learned all about Substrate and how to create a Substrate based blockchain.
In this tutorial, we will learn about how to start a blockchain network with an authority set of private validators, how to generate your own secret key pairs, how to create a custom chain specification that uses the generated keys & add validators to a private network that uses your custom chain specification.

## Practice

Follow the tutorial here [Start a private network](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/private-network/) 

## Testing

When ready, reach out to [schedule a test](https://github.com/antron3000/Polkadot-L-EARN/blob/master/Lessons/English/L_EARN/L1:Intro_To_Polkadot_L-EARN.md#schedule-a-test)

To pass the test you must
- complete the practice tutorial
- display understanding of substrate blockchains
- run a substrate based blockchain node
- demonstrate a front end project that interacts with your node
