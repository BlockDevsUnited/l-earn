# How to setup xDai Chain and DCASH to Metamask

The xDai chain is an Ethereum-based sidechain that uses a Proof-of-Stake mechanism. The native currency is xDAI that is pegged to US Dollar. A transaction on the xDai chain costs a few pennies and will confirm in a matter of seconds, compared to many dollars and likely many minutes on the Ethereum chain.


# setup the xDai network on Metamask

   1. Open Metamask

   2. Click on "Ethereum Main Network" 

      2.1 and select "Custom RPC" from the Network Dropdown.

 3. Enter the xDai network information in the following order:


                                          Network name: xDai
                                          New RPC URL: https://rpc.xdaichain.com/
                                          String ID: 0x64 (100)
                                          Symbol: xDai
                                          Block Explorer URL: https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet


4. Lastly, save and connect by changing from Ethereum network to xDai


Note: Chain ID 0x64 is the hexadecimal equivalent of 100, which is the xDai chain ID. MetaMask recently updated the ChainID to be a required field. When you update, you may need to reenter the Chain ID: 100, and it will be converted to a hexadecimal: 0x64.
## If you are having issues, try entering 100 for Chain ID and resaving the configuration.

# What is DCASH?

DevCash(DCASH) is an ERC20 token on Ethereum, and bridged to xDaiChain. Devcash is BDU’s native cryptocurrency and economic engine. Devcash began as an ERC20 token on Ethereum, and is being extended to other chains. BDU has set up Devcash and related apps on a Layer 2 network — [xDai Network](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/token/0x248E081e3C9e738D7C1ded5d471069dcf4Fd9B15/)
Devcash has been bridged to xDAI STAKE using the xDai omni bridge.
