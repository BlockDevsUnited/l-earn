# What are cryptocurrencies?
A cryptocurrency or crypto is a **digital** coin that used **cryptography** to provide a secure payment system. Let's separate the keywords of that definition:

  * **Digital coin** : Unlike the euro, the dollar, the peso and the bolivar, a cryptocurrency cannot be physically represented as cash or a coin, which is why they are said to be digital.
  * **Cryptography** : It is used to transform data into messages that cannot be decrypted by unauthorized users, for which there are different algorithms. This technique is one of the fundamental bases of blockchain technology (on which cryptocurrencies are created) and what makes it so secure.

 
 
# What are the main cryptocurrency types??
Now that you understand what a cryptocurrency is, let's learn aboure the types of crypto that we can find on the market:
  
  * **Bitcoin**: It's a crypto by itself, that's why is the most important digital coin on the cryptomarket. The objective pursued by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym used to refer to the creator of bitcoin) when creating bitcoin was to develop an electronic payment system that would allow its users to carry out transactions among themselves without the need for an intermediary such as bank..
  * **Altcoin**: After the big success of Bitcoin, many people were encouraged to develop their own cryptocurrencies, becoming these coins an investment alternatives to bitcoin, they are called "altcoins" or "alternative coins" in English. What differentiates them from bitcoin are the uses that can be given to them. For example, ethereum (one of the most famous altcoins) was created so that developers 
  * could build decentralized applications (also known as Dapps) and smart contracts. However, like bitcoin, altcoins have their own networks, mostly based on blockchain technology, through which they can conduct their own transactions according to the rules set out in the code of their respective smart contracts. According to CoinMarketCap there are at least 856 altcoins.
  *  **Token**: The main difference with bitcoin and altcoins is that tokens depend on the network of another cryptocurrency to carry out their transactions (since they do not have their own network) which is why it is said that they are easier to create than a cryptocurrency, since it is not necessary to develop a blockchain from scratch. According to CoinMarketCap, there are at least 1496 tokens created on the blockchain of 24 cryptocurrencies. 
   Also, the blockchain on which the most tokens have been created is that of Ethereum, better known as ERC-20 tokens.
   
   
   Another way to classify cryptos is:
  * **Privacy Coins**: are those that focus on providing private transactions, some examples: Dash, Monero.
  * **Stablecoins**: These are those cryptocurrencies that are linked to "stable" assets such as the dollar to reduce the large price variation that cryptos tend to have. 
   Some examples: USD coin, Tether, xDai.
  * **Exchange tokens**: These are cryptocurrencies created by exchanges to be used mainly for trading on their platforms and to opt for other services. Some examples are: Binance Coin, Huobi Token, Kucoin. 
  * **Central Bank Digital Currencies**: These are cryptocurrencies created or backed by a central bank. An example of this is the digital yuan, a cryptocurrency under development by the People's Bank of China.
